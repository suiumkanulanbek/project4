# Drug Overdose Deaths in the United States

This project analyzes trends and patterns in drug overdose deaths in the United States, using publicly available data from the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**. The analysis focuses on the rise of opioid-related deaths and other substances over time, highlighting one of the most pressing public health challenges in recent U.S. history.

## Data Source

- **Source**: [CDC WONDER & National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm)
